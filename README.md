1. Brand vs. Selling Price:
Certain brands command significantly higher selling prices than others, indicating brand reputation and perceived value are major factors in pricing.
The variation in prices among different brands can help identify premium and budget segments.
3. Transmission vs. Selling Price:
There is a noticeable difference in selling prices based on the type of transmission.
Cars with automatic transmissions tend to have higher selling prices compared to those with manual transmissions, suggesting a market preference or perceived value in automatic vehicles.
4. Fuel Type vs. Selling Price:
There is variability in selling prices across different fuel types, with certain fuel types (possibly petrol or diesel) being more valuable than others (like CNG or LPG).
This could reflect market demand, cost of fuel, or performance considerations.
5. Seller Type vs. Selling Price:
Dealerships appear to command higher selling prices compared to individual sellers or other categories.
Buyers may perceive dealership sales as more trustworthy or reliable, justifying the higher prices.
6. Torque vs. Selling Price:
There is a correlation between torque and selling price, with vehicles offering higher torque typically fetching higher prices.
This could be due to the performance capabilities associated with higher torque.
7. Engine vs. Selling Price:
Engine specifications play a crucial role in determining the selling price, with more powerful engines being valued higher.
The data suggests that engine capacity is a significant factor for buyers when assessing a vehicle's value.
8. Max Power vs. Selling Price:
Similar to engine specs, maximum power output also shows a positive correlation with selling price.
High-performance vehicles with greater power are likely to be priced higher, appealing to a specific market segment.
9. Number of Owners vs. Selling Price:
Cars with fewer previous owners tend to have higher selling prices, highlighting the importance of ownership history in valuation.
This reflects buyer preference for vehicles that are perceived as less used or better maintained.

Insights:
Pricing Strategy: Sellers should consider brand reputation, transmission type, and fuel type when pricing their vehicles to maximize returns.
Market Targeting: Marketing strategies should highlight features like low ownership, high engine power, and automatic transmission to attract higher bids.
Buyer Education: Buyers should be made aware of the impact of factors like year of manufacture, torque, and engine capacity on car prices, helping them make informed decisions.
